                    <p>I'm Maria. I am a mom of two. I have a husband who I think is the most amazing guy in the world.
                        I really
                        got that lucky. He has been my rock throughout this process. I took all of my prereqs in
                        nursing. I stopped, had my son. By the time I thought about going back for nursing, a lot of my
                        prereqs
                        expired.Plus I wasn-'t thrilled with the idea of 4 years of school, especially with having a
                        family. My
                        husband
                        always said, if he could go back to school it would be for computers. He being the guy who
                        started in
                        nursing and ended with his major in dietetics. Now he sells insurance. He always says a degree
                        is just a
                        piece of paper. I agree with that to some extent. I do wish earlier in life I had gone to school. But I am
                        grateful I
                        skipped out of wracking up a ton of debt. I thought later in life I would possibly be going to
                        college
                        with my kids. Then that thought terrified me. I decided to research the types of computer jobs.
                        Types of
                        schooling for computers. Computer science degree's, basically anything under the sun with the
                        word
                        computer in it. I stumbled onto coding. I was shocked finding out you didn't need a degree in
                        this
                        field. Amazed at the salary of a web-developer. I tried a free coding Bootcamp online. I knew
                        from there
                        that this was for me.</p>
